# whatsapp-web
This is just a fun project that have a similar interface to whatsapp web login page but the qrcode here doesn't perform anything related to whatsapp instead of it this will take you to my instagram I'd.
you can also contribute to it, just code something and make a pull request. I will try to go through it.
Also share the link (https://priyans-hu.github.io/whatsapp-web) with your friends and ask them that does this looks similar to real whatsapp web(https://web.whatsapp.com) or not.
Currently this is only designed for laptops, so any other kind of device will not display this properly.
